This was a bot that was supposed to sync each of our [Minecraft](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition) worlds' in-game chats with a corresponding [Slack](https://slack.com/) channel, like [wurstminebot](https://github.com/wurstmineberg/wurstminebot) from the [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) era did. Due to [limitations](https://github.com/slack-rs/slack-rs/issues/50) in the library at the time, it never really worked. We have since moved to [Discord](https://discord.com/) and this project has been replaced with [wurstminebot-discord](https://github.com/wurstmineberg/wurstminebot-discord) which does work.
